An R package template with built-in GitHub Actions-based CI/CD workflows.

## Usage

### Initialization

You could initialize this repository in one of two ways:

#### Clone this template

* Clone this repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/insightsengineering/coursera.cicd.lab.git
  cd coursera.cicd.lab
  ```

* Run the initializer script:

  ```bash
  ./init.sh
  ```

#### Use GitHub's template importer

* Click [here](https://github.com/insightsengineering/coursera.cicd.lab/generate) to generate a copy of this template directly within GitHub.

* Clone the repository from your account/organization.

* Run the initializer script:

  ```bash
  ./init.sh
  ```

### CI/CD Configurations

All CI/CD jobs are defined in the [.github/workflows](./.github/workflows) directory in the form of GitHub Action workflows. These can be modified per your requirements, but are designed and implemented to follow best practices and to ensure the highest quality standards for your package.

All workflows originating from this repository can be repurposed by other R package GitHub repositories.

👉 For more information including detailed description and screenshots of workflows, please refer to the [Workflows documentation](./workflows.md).

### Pre-commit

This repository contains an example [pre-commit] configuration.

[pre-commit] is a tool that uses [Git hooks] to identify and resolve simple issues before submission for code review.
[Git hooks] run on every commit to automatically point out and solve issues such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespaces,
code formatting and spell checks.

### Setting up pre-commit for R project

* Install the `pre-commit` framework. Use the official [installation guide][pre-commit installation].

* Install R package `precommit`

  ```sh
  R -e 'install.packages("precommit")'
  ```

* Run the `use_precommit()` function to generate an example pre-commit configuration called `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

  ```sh
  [ ! -f ".pre-commit-config.yaml" ] && R -e 'precommit::use_precommit()'
  ```

* Install the git hooks script:

  ```sh
  pre-commit install
  ```

* From this moment on, all scripts from `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will run before every `git commit` command. If you want to run them manually without committing you can use command `pre-commit run --all-files`. For more information, please refer to the official [pre-commit] documentation.

> NOTE: Frequently run `pre-commit autoupdate` to update all hooks in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file.

### Example output from pre-commit

```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add pre-commit configuration"

   ignored in the future.
 Then, try committing again.
